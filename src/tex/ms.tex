% Abstract with filler text
\begin{abstract}
New observational facilities are probing astrophysical transients such as stellar explosions and gravitational wave (GW) sources at ever increasing redshifts. To interpret these observation we need to compare them to predictions from stellar population models. These models, require the metallicity-dependent star formation rate density (\SFRDzZ) as an input. Large uncertainties remain in the shape and evolution of this function, and understanding its behaviour is essential to explain simulation results. 
% Large uncertainties remain in the value and shape of the \SFRDzZ, especially at the low metallicities that are crucial to the formation of GW events.
% Understanding the behaviour of the adopted metallicity distribution with which stars form is essential to explain simulation results. 
% Various approaches to approximate \SFRDzZ exist, ranging from fully empirical prescriptions to prescriptions that are based on cosmological simulations.
In this work, we propose a simple analytical function for \SFRDzZ. 
% The novelty of this model lies in a skewed-lognormal distribution of metallicities, that captures the tail of low metallicity star formation at low redshift. 
Variations of this function can be easily interpreted, because the parameters link to its shape in an intuitive way. %Our hope is that this expression provides a useful starting point for making predictions and comparison with observations.
We fit our analytical function to the star-forming gas of the cosmological TNG100 simulations and find that it is able to capture the main behaviour well. 
%
As an example application, we investigate the effect of systematic variations in the \SFRDzZ parameters on the predicted mass distribution of locally merging binary black holes (BBH). Our main findings are I) the location of features is remarkably robust against variations in the metallicity-dependent star formation rate and II) the low mass end is least affected by these variations. This is promising as it increases our chances to constrain the physics that governs the formation of these objects.
We further find that III) the skewness, mean, and width of the metallicity distribution at low redshift affect the overall rate, while IV) the redshift evolution of the width and the mean of the metallicity distribution affects the slope at the high-mass end of the distribution. 
% IV) the shape of the overall star-formation rate has a small impact on the local mass distribution.

\section{Introduction \label{sec: intro}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A myriad of astrophysical phenomena depend critically on the rate of star formation throughout the cosmic history of the Universe. Exotic transient phenomena, including (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae, long gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave (GW) events appear to be especially sensitive to the metallicity at which star formation occurs at different epochs throughout the Universe \citep[e.g.,][]{Langer+2007,Fruchter+2006,LIGO2016_implications}.
Gravitational astronomy in particular has seen explosive growth in the number of detections in the past decade \citep[][]{GWTC1,GWTC2,GWTC3}. In order to correctly model and interpret these observations, it is fundamental to know the rate of star formation at different metallicities throughout cosmic history, i.e. the metallicity-dependent star formation rate density  \citep[\SFRDzZ, see also the recent review by][]{chruslinska2022_review}. Throughout this work little $z$ refers to the redshift and $Z$ the metallicity of star formation. 


It is difficult to observationally constrain the shape of \SFRDzZ, see \cite{Chruslinska2019_obs} for an extensive overview and discussion of relevant observational caveats. Even at low redshifts, the low metallicity part of the distribution is poorly constrained \citep{Chruslinska+2021}.
Nonetheless, several methods exist to estimate the metallicity dependent star-formation rate. 

The first method combines a galaxy mass-metallicity relation, MZ-relation and a galaxy stellar mass function, GSMF \citep[see e.g.][]{Dominik+2013}. However, the applied methods to infer galaxy properties and subsequently scaling relations such as the MZ-relation differ greatly, which makes it difficult to interpret these results in a consistent way \citep[e.g.,][]{KewleyEllison2008,MaiolinoMannucci2019,Cresci+2019}. Moreover, observations are generally incomplete at high redshifts and low galaxy luminosity \citep[e.g.,][]{Chruslinska+2021}.

% \citep[see e.g.][]{Chruslinska+2018, Chruslinska2019_effectCO, Broekgaarden+2021a}.
One can also directly extract the metallicity density fraction from cosmological simulations \citep[e.g.][]{Mapelli2017, Briel+2021}. However, these simulations currently lack the resolution to resolve the lowest mass galaxies, and their variations in \SFRDzZ span a smaller range than those observed in observationally-based models \citep{Pakmor+2022}.

Alternatively, one can combine analytical models for the observed star formation rate, \SFRDz, like those from \cite{MadauDickinson2014} or \cite{Madau+2017}, and convolve this with an assumed function for the shape of the shape of the metallicity density distribution, such as was was done in e.g., \cite{LangerNorman, Neijssel+2019}.

%Arguments: cosmological simulations work at high z,  but are they real? observations 
In this work we follow the latter approach and propose a flexible analytical model for the \SFRDzZ that can be fit to the output of both cosmological simulations, and observational data constraints where available. 
In contrast to earlier work, we adopt a skewed-lognormal distribution of metallicities that can capture the asymmetry in the low and high metallicity tails. %\citep{LangerNorman, Neijssel+2019}

The purpose of this proposed form is twofold.  
First of all, the form we propose allows for an intuitive interpretation of the free parameters. This allows us to get better insight of the impact of changes in these parameters on the inferred ranges of astrophysical transients (as we demonstrate in Section \ref{sec: mass dists} using GW predictions as an example). By adopting an analytical, parametrized form for \SFRDzZ, the large uncertainties can be systematically explored.
%
Secondly, both the large complications in observational constraints, and the many uncertainties in cosmological simulations call for a generalised form of the \SFRDzZ that can be easily updated when new information becomes available. % which is the motivation for this work. 
In particular, the advent of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope promises a new era of high-redshift
metallicity studies of previously unexplored regimes \citep[e.g.,][]{Sanders+2022}. We hope that this form will facilitate the flexibility needed to keep up with observations. 
% we hope that this form will facilitate a more sensible way for useful inference on large (future) datasets of astrophysical transients, such as the ever growing catalogue of gravitational wave transients. Our hope is that the constraints on the free parameters in the analytical form we propose, can provide a more useful guidance when comparing with the outcome of the predictions of cosmological simulations. 

% is to allow for an intuitive interpretation of the effects of the \SFRDzZ on the inferred rates of astrophysical transients. By adopting an analytical, parametrized form for \SFRDzZ, the large uncertainties in \SFRDzZ can be systematically explored.% through varying the parameters that control its shape.


We describe our model for \SFRDzZ in Section \ref{sec: model for sfrd(zZ)}.
We fit our model to to the star-forming gas in the Illustris TNG100 simulation in Section \ref{sec: fit against tng} we demonstrate an example application of our model by systematically varying the parameters that determine the shape of \SFRDzZ and investigate their impact on the local distribution of merging BBH masses in Section \ref{sec: mass dists}.
We summarise our findings in Section \ref{sec: summary}.

Throughout this work, we adopt a Kroupa initial mass function \citep{Kroupa2001} and a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_{\rm{M}}=0.31$, $\Omega_{\rm{\Lambda}}=0.69$ and $H_0=67.7\rm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ \citep{Planck18_VI}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{A convenient analytic expression for the metallicity-dependent star formation rate density \label{sec: model for sfrd(zZ)} }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We assume that the metallicity dependent star formation rate density can be separated into two independent functions \citep[e.g.\ ][]{Langer2006},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: total sfrd}
\boxed{
        \SFRDzZ = \SFRDz \times \dPdZ.
        }
\end{equation}
The first term is the star formation rate density, \SFRDz, that is the amount of mass formed in stars per unit time and per unit comoving volume at each redshift, $z$. The second term, \dpdZ, is a probability density function that expresses what fraction of star formation occurs at which metallicity, $Z$, at each redshift. 
 
%% SFR(z) %%

% $a=0.02$, $b=1.48$, $c=4.45$ and $d=5.9$ as best fitting parameters,
\subsection{The metallicity probability density function}
For the probability distribution of metallicities we draw inspiration from the approach by e.g., \cite{Neijssel+2019} who used a log-normal distribution. Unfortunately, this expression does not capture the asymmetry well that we see in the results of the cosmological simulations, which show an extended tail in  $\log_{10} Z$ towards low metallicity, combined with a very limited tail towards higher metallicity. To capture this behaviour we adopt a skewed-log-normal distribution instead. This is an extension of the normal distribution that introduces an additional shape parameter, $\alpha$, that regulates the skewness \citep[first introduced by][]{Ohagan+1976}. 

The skewed-log-normal distribution of metallicities is defined as:
% See eq. 1 here: https://www.emis.de/journals/RCE/V36/v36n1a03.pdf
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq: pure log skew}
\mathrm{\frac{dP}{dZ}}(Z) &= \frac{1}{Z} \times \frac{\rm dP}{{\rm d}\ln Z}  \\
&= \frac{1}{Z} \times \frac{2}{\omega}
    \underbrace { \phi \left(\frac{\ln Z - \xi}{\omega}\right)
                 }_{(a)}
    \underbrace {
                \Phi\left(\alpha \frac{\ln Z - \xi}{\omega} \right)
                }_{(b)},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\noindent where (a) is the standard log-normal distribution, $\phi$,
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: log normal and CDF}
 \phi \left(\frac{\ln Z - \xi}{\omega}\right) \equiv 
% \underbrace{
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} 
    \exp{
         \left\{
            -\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\ln Z - \xi}{\omega}\right)^2
        \right\}
        }
  %  }_{(1)} 
    \end{equation}
and (b) is the new term that allows for asymmetry, which is equal to the cumulative of the log-normal distribution, $\Phi$,
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{cc}
 \Phi\left(\alpha \frac{\ln Z - \xi}{\omega} \right) &\equiv 
    \frac{1}{2} 
    \left[ 
        1 + {\rm erf}
            \left\{
                \alpha \frac{\ln Z - \xi}{\omega \sqrt{2}}
            \right\} 
    \right] \\
    \end{array}
\end{equation}

%
\noindent This introduces three parameters, $\alpha, \omega$ and $\xi$, each of which may depend on redshift. The first parameter, $\alpha$, is known as the ``shape''. It affects the skewness of the distribution and thus allows for asymmetries between metallicities that are higher and lower than the mean.  The symmetric log-normal distribution is recovered for $\alpha=0$. The second parameter, $\omega$  is known as the ``scale''. It provides a measure of the spread in metallicities at each redshift.   Finally, $\xi$, is known as the ``location'', because this parameter plays a role in setting the mean of the distribution at each redshift.

\paragraph{The location and the mean of the metallicity distribution}
To obtain a useful expression for the redshift dependence of the ``location'' $\xi(z)$ we first express the expectation value or mean metallicity at a given redshift
% eq. 8 here: https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/pii/S0021850219300400
% Using k = 1 for the first moment
\begin{equation}
 \langle  Z \rangle 
 = 2 \exp
        \left(\xi +  \frac{\omega^2}{2} \right)
         \Phi\left(\beta\, \omega\right)
 \label{eqn:Zmean}
\end{equation}
where $\beta$ is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: beta}
\beta = \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1 + \alpha^2} }.
\end{equation}

For a more extended derivation of the moments of the skewed-log-normal, see e.g., \cite{WANG201995}.

\noindent For the evolution of the mean metallicity with redshift we follow \cite{Langer2006} and \cite{Neijssel+2019} in assuming that the mean of the probability density function of metallicities evolves with redshift as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: mean Z}
    \langle Z \rangle \equiv \mu(z) = \mu_0 \cdot 10^{\mu_z \cdot z},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_0
%= 0.025 
$ is the mean metallicity at redshift 0, and $\mu_z
%= -0.048
$ determines redshift evolution of the location. Equating this to Equation~\ref{eqn:Zmean}, we get an expression for $\xi(z)$,

% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq mu z}
%     \xi(z) = -\frac{\omega^2}{2}\, \ln\left(\frac{  \mu_0 \cdot 10^{\mu_z \cdot z} }{2\, \Phi(\beta\, \omega)}  \right).
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq mu z}
    \xi(z) = \ln\left(\frac{  \mu_0 \cdot 10^{\mu_z \cdot z} }{2\, \Phi(\beta\, \omega)}  \right) - \frac{\omega^2}{2}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{The scale (and variance) of the metallicity distribution}

We will also allow the ``scale'' $\omega$ to evolve with redshift in a similar manner, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: omega z}
    \omega(z) = \omega_0 \cdot 10^{\omega_z \cdot z}.
\end{equation}
where $\omega_0$ is
%$\omega_0 = 1.125$, 
the width of the metallicity distribution at $z=0$, and $\omega_z$
%$\omega_z = 0.048$, 
the redshift evolution of the scale.

Note that the width, $w(z)$ is not the same as the variance. The variance, $\sigma(z)^2$, can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
    \sigma(z)^2 = \omega(z)^2 \left( 1 - \frac{2\beta^2}{\pi} \right)
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Asymmetry of the metallicity distribution: $\alpha$}
The skewness $\alpha$ could in principle also be allowed to evolve with redshift (e.g., $\alpha (z) = \alpha(z=0) 10^{\alpha_z \cdot z}$). 
However, we find no significant improvement over the simpler assumption where alpha is kept constant. 
Note that the redshift evolution of the `scale' (eq. \ref{eq: omega z}), already captures similar behaviour in our current formalism. We therefore adopt $ \alpha = \alpha(z=0)$ and $\alpha_z = 0$.

In summary, Equation~\ref{eq: pure log skew} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: z log skew}
\boxed{
    \dPdZ = \frac{2}{\omega(z) Z} \times \phi \left(\frac{\ln Z - \xi(z)}{\omega(z)}\right) \Phi\left(\alpha \frac{\ln Z - \xi(z)}{\omega(z)} \right)
    } \ , 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\xi(z)$ and $\omega(z)$ are defined in Equations~\ref{eq mu z} and \ref{eq: omega z} respectively and we have assumed $\alpha$ to be constant.

%, and our fit value for $\alpha = -1.77$. Our set of parameters for \dpdZ is thus:  $\mu_0 = 0.025, \mu_z = -0.048, \omega_0 = 1.125, \omega_z = 0.048$ and $\alpha = -1.77$.

\subsection{The overall cosmic star formation rate density}
For the star formation rate density, we assume the analytical form proposed by \cite{MadauDickinson2014},
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq: sfr1}
\boxed{
    \SFRDz  = 
    \frac{d^2 M_{\rm SFR}}{dt dV_c} (z)= 
    a \frac{\left(1 + z\right)^b}{1 + \left[ (1 + z)/c \right]^d} 
    }\,
\end{eqnarray}
in units of $\left[ \Msun \,yr^{-1} \,cMpc^{-3} \right]$. This introduces four parameters; $a$ which sets the overal normalisation and which has the same units as \SFRDz and $b,c$ and $d$ which are unitless and which govern the shape of the overal cosmic star formation rate density with redshift. \\

% \subsection{Combined function}
Lastly, we combine equations \ref{eq: z log skew} and \ref{eq: sfr1} to form a full metallicity specific star formation rate density as described in equation \ref{eq: total sfrd}.

\end{figure*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We fit our new functional form of \SFRDzZ as defined by equations \ref{eq: total sfrd}, \ref{eq: z log skew} and \ref{eq: sfr1} to the Illustris-TNG cosmological simulations. 
We simultaneously fit for the following nine free parameters $\alpha, \mu_0, \mu_z, \omega_0, \omega_z$, which govern the metallicity dependence and $a,b, c$ and $d$, which set the overall star formation rate.

Below we briefly discuss the Illustris-TNG simulations, and elaborate on our fitting procedure.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Illustris-TNG Cosmological simulations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Both the large observational uncertainties in \SFRDzZ (as discussed in section \ref{sec: intro}), and the many uncertainties in cosmological simulations (as discussed below) call for a generalised form of the \SFRDzZ that can be easily updated when new information becomes available, which is the motivation for this work. 
% In particular, the advent of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope promises a new era of high-redshift% metallicity studies in previously unexplored regimes \citep[e.g.,][]{Sanders+2022}.
%
Although here, we only fit our model to the TNG100 simulation, our prescription can be easily be used to fit other simulated or observational data of the metallicity dependent star formation rate density\footnote{We provide a Jupyter notebook to facilitate this fit here: \url{https://github.com/LiekeVanSon/SFRD_fit/blob/main/src/scripts/Fit_To_Cosmological_Simulation.ipynb} }.

The IllustrisTNG-project \citep[or TNG in short,][]{FirstResTNG_Springel2018,FirstResTNG_Marinacci2018, FirstResTNG_Nelson2018,FirstResTNG_Pillepich2018, FirstResTNG_Naiman2018} considers galaxy formation and evolution through large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
Such simulations provide the tools to study parts of the Universe that are not easily accessible by observations. In particular of interest for this work, they simulate the high redshift enrichment of galaxies and the tail of low metallicity star formation at low redshift.
% Different cosmological simulations produce varying \SFRDzZ, depending on the adopted assumptions about the creation and distribution of metals. 

The models implemented in the publicly available TNG simulations\footnote{ \url{https://www.tng-project.org/}} have lead to many successes. For a more extended discussion focused on the processes that govern the creation, distribution and mixing of metals in in the TNG simulations we refer to \cite{Pakmor+2022}. In short, star formation in the TNG simulations is calibrated against the Kennicutt–Schmidt relation \citep[][]{Schmidt1959,Kennicutt1989}. The stellar metallicity yields are an updated version of the original Illustris simulations as described in \cite{Pillepich2018}. Star particles deposit metals into the gas through type Ia and type II supernovae, as well as through asymptotic giant branch stars. 
% Positives on TNG
The TNG simulations have been shown to match observational constraints on the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies up to $z = 2$ \citep{Torrey+2019}, as well as iron abundances \citep{FirstResTNG_Naiman2018} and the metallicity gradients within galaxies at low redshift \citep{Hemler+2021}. %They reproduce the evolution of the sizes of galaxies with redshift \citep{Genel+2018}   
Several studies have used the TNG simulations to make predictions for astronomical transient sources \citep[e.g.][]{Briel+2021,Bavera+2022,vanson+2022}. In particular, \cite{Briel+2021} show that the \SFRDzZ from the TNG and the EAGLE \citep{Schaye+2015,Crain+2015} simulations provide the best agreement between observed and predicted cosmic rates for electromagnetic and gravitational-wave transients. 

% Downsides of TNG100 
On the other hand, large uncertainties and crude approximations remain in all contemporary cosmological simulations, thus also in the TNG simulations. For example, dust is not included in the TNG simulations, which could mean that metallicity of the star-forming gas is overestimated. Furthermore, all stellar winds mass loss from massive stars, binary interactions and their ionising effects are ignored \citep[e.g.][]{Dray+2003,Smith2014,Gotberg+2020,DoughtyFinlator2021,Farmer2021_carbonfootprint,Goswami+2022}.
% pair-pulsational supernovae \citep[e.g.][]{Renzo+2020} .  
Moreover, the uniform ionising UV background is turned on abruptly at $z=6$, which crucially impacts the amount of low metallicity star formation at low redshift.

% These large uncertainties call for a generalised form of the \SFRDzZ that can be easily updated when new information becomes available, which is the motivation for this work. Although here, we only fit our model to the TNG100 simulation, our prescription can be easily be used to fit other simulated data or observational data of the metallicity dependent star formation rate density \footnote{We provide a Jupyter notebook to facilitate this fit here: \url{https://github.com/LiekeVanSon/SFRD_fit/blob/main/src/scripts/Fit_To_Cosmological_Simulation.ipynb} }.

We fit equation \ref{eq: total sfrd} to the metallicity-dependent star formation rate of the star-forming gas in the TNG100 simulation. For this we use a binned version of the TNG data $\SFRDzZ_{\rm sim}$. We consider metallicities between $\log_{10} Z= -5$ to $\log_{10} Z= 0$ in 30 bins, where we use $Z_i$ to refer to the logarithmic centres of the bins. We ignore star formation in metallicities $\log_{10} Z \le -5$ as this accounts for less than 1\% of the total cosmic star formation rate in these simulations.
We consider bins in redshifts between $z=0$ and $z=10$, with a step size of $dz=0.05$, where $z_j$ refers to the centres of the bins. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Optimisation function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To find a solution we use a method based on the sum of the quadratic differences between the simulations and our fit function. Using a vanilla $\chi$-squared approach does not serve our purposes very well as it does a poor job in fitting regions where the star formation is very low.  Using a $\chi$-squared approach on the logarithm of the function instead places far too much weight on trying to fit the star formation rate in regions where the rate is very low or not even significant.  After experimenting, we find that the following approach gives us satisfactory results. 

We first consider a given redshift $z_j$.  For this redshift we compute the sum of the squared residuals between the cosmological simulation and our fit.  
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq: chisquare}
    \chi^2 (z_j) \equiv \sum_{Z_i} \left( 
        \mathcal{S}(Z_i,z_j)_{\rm sim} - 
        \mathcal{S}(Z_i,z_j)_{\rm fit}\right)^2
    %chi_square = ((obs - model )**2)/np.sum(model) 
\end{equation}
%
Here, the variable $Z_i$ runs over all redshift bins.
%, but excludes bins where the star formation rate density is lower $10^{-10} \Msun \yr \Mpc^{-3}$ per bin. 
% Subsequently we sum the $\chi^2 (z_j)$ for all redshift bins $z_j$. 
We are particularly interested in properly fitting the low metallicity star formation at high redshifts. At high redshifts, the overall cosmic star formation rate is generally lower. To ensure that our fit procedure gives sufficient weight to the behaviour at all redshifts, we introduce a penalisation factor to somewhat reduce the contribution of redshifts where the peak of cosmic star formation occurs, while increasing the weight where at redshifts where the overall cosmic star formation rate is lower.  To achieve this we divide $\chi^2 (z_j)$ by the star formation $\sum_{Z_i} \mathcal{S}(Z_i,z_j)$ per redshift bin before adding the contribution of all redshifts.  Our final expression for the cost function reads

\begin{equation}
\label{eq: cost function}
    \chi  = \sum_{z_j} \frac{ \chi^2 (z_j) } 
        {\sum_{Z_i} \mathcal{S}(Z_i,z_j)}
    %chi_square = ((obs - model )**2)/np.sum(model) 
\end{equation}

To minimize this cost funciton, we use \texttt{scipy.optimize.minimize} from SciPy v1.6.3 which implements the quasi-Newton method of Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno \citep[BFGS,][]{NocedalWright_numerical_optimization}.

\subsection{Resulting \SFRDzZ}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our best fitting parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab: fit params}. With these fit parameters, $\chi^2(z_j)$ is smaller than $2\cdot 10^{-4}$ at any given redshift. We will refer to the \SFRDzZ with the parameters listed in Table \ref{tab: fit params} as our fiducial model. 
% With the fit parameters as mentioned above, we find a maximum residual between the model and the TNG100 data of $2.3\cdot 10^{-3} \Msun \yr^{-1} \Mpc^{-3}$ at any given redshift.

In Figure \ref{fig: fit SFRD} we show our fiducial  model at different redshifts and metallicities. We also show the overall rate of star formation \SFRDz in Figure \ref{fig: SFR(z)}.
In general, our analytical model captures the metallicity dependent star formation in the TNG100 simulations well (bottom panels of Figure \ref{fig: fit SFRD}). 
The skewed-log normal metallicity distribution is able to reproduce the overall behaviour that is observed in TNG100 \citep[bottom left panel, but cf. ][for an in-depth discussion of low metallicity star formation in the TNG50 simulation]{Pakmor+2022}.
Only minor features like the additional bump just above $\log_{10}(Z) = -2$ at redshift 2 are missed. 
However, for our purposes, it is more important to prioritise fitting the large scale trends, while we are not so interested in smaller scale fluctuations.

Adopting a skewed-lognormal metallicity distribution allows for a tail of low metallicity star formation out to low redshifts. To emphasise the difference between a skewed-lognormal and a symmetric lognormal distribution, we show the phenomenological model from \cite{Neijssel+2019} in dotted grey. Their model falls within the family of functions that is encompassed by our model described in Section \ref{sec: model for sfrd(zZ)}, but we note that their model is very distinctly different.\footnote{The phenomenological model from \cite{Neijssel+2019} is recovered by adopting $\mu_0= 0.035$, $\mu_z=-0.23$, $\omega_0=0.39 $, $\omega_z = 0$, $\alpha = 0$, $a=0.01$, $b=2.77$, $c=2.9$ and $d=4.7$. }
% The \SFRDzZ from \cite{Neijssel+2019} was optimised to match the local rate of double compact object mergers as presented in the second gravitational-wave catalogue. However, the resulting symmetric distribution cuts-off virtually all low-metallicity ($Z\leq 10^{-2.5}$) star formation.

% For both \SFRDzZ distributions, most star formation happens at metallicities above $Z \geq 10^{-2}$ (top panel).

\section{Application: systematic variations of \SFRDzZ and the effect on the mass distribution of merging BBHs \label{sec: mass dists}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We will now demonstrate the application of our analytical model by systematically varying the parameters in our fiducial \SFRDzZ model, and investigate their effect on the local mass distribution of BBH mergers originating from isolated binaries. 


We use the publicly available rapid binary population synthesis simulations presented in \cite{vanson+2022}. 
These simulations were run using version v02.19.04 of the open source \COMPAS suite \citep{COMPAS_method}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS}}. \COMPAS is based on algorithms that model the evolution of massive binary stars following \citet{Hurley+2000, Hurley+2002} using detailed evolutionary models by \citet{Pols+1998}.  We refer the reader to the methods section of \cite{vanson+2022} for a detailed description of our adopted physics parameters and assumptions.
%
Metallicities of each binary system were sampled from a smooth probability distribution to avoid artificial peaks in the BH mass distribution \citep[e.g.][]{Dominik2015,Kummer_thesis}. 
These simulations provide us with an estimate of the yield of BBH mergers per unit of star-forming mass and metallicity. 

We combine the aforementioned yield with variations of the fiducial \SFRDzZ model described in this work. By integrating over cosmic history, we obtain the local merger rates of BBH systems, which allow us to construct the distribution of source properties at every redshift. The details of this framework are described in \cite{vanson+2022}, but also in \cite{Broekgaarden+2021a} and \cite{Neijssel+2019}. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Determining reasonable variations of \SFRDzZ \label{ss: reasonable var}}
We consider variations in both the shape of the cosmic metallicity distribution \dpdZ, and the shape of the overall star-formation history, \SFRDz. To determine the range that is reasonably allowed by observations, we compare our variations to the observation-based \SFRDzZ models described in \cite{Chruslinska+2021}.

For the cosmic metallicity distribution, we vary every parameter that determines the shape of \dpdZ independently (left two columns of Table \ref{tab: fit params}).
For every variation, we inspect the fraction of stellar mass that is formed at low-metallicity ($Z<0.1 Z_{\odot}$) versus the fraction of stellar mass that is formed at high-metallicity ($Z> Z_{\odot}$), for all star formation that occurred below a certain threshold redshift.
We compare this to the models from \cite{Chruslinska+2021} in Figure \ref{fig: low high Z fraction} in Appendix \ref{app: reasonable var}.
We have chosen our variations such that they span the range of reasonable cosmic metallicity distributions as determined by observation-based and cosmological simulations-based models.
For completeness, we furthermore inspect every variation by eye, and make sure none of the variations significantly exceeds the low and high metallicity extremes from \cite{Chruslinska+2021}.\footnote{We  compare to the low metallicity extreme model: \texttt{214f14SBBiC\_FMR270\_FOH\_z\_dM.dat}, and the high metallicity extreme model: \texttt{302f14SBBoco\_FMR270\_FOH\_z\_dM.dat}.}

Lastly, we consider two variations of the overall star-formation history, \SFRDz, where we keep the metallicity distribution \dpdZ fixed, but vary all four \SFRDz parameters at once (right two columns of Table \ref{tab: fit params}). 
We use Figure 11 from \cite{Chruslinska+2021} to determine approximate upper and lower bounds to the overall star-formation history. We choose \cite{Madau+2017} as an approximation of the lower limit. For the upper limit, we use the \texttt{SB: B18/C17} model variations with a non-evolving low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function from \cite{Chruslinska+2021} (thick brown line in their Fig. 11). To approximate these models, we fit equation \ref{eq: sfr1} by eye to the broken power law description for the  \texttt{SB: B18/C17} model variations as presented in appendix B1 from \cite{Chruslinska+2021}.
We show all \SFRDz variations in Figure~\ref{fig: SFR(z)}. \\

\end{figure*}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The effect of the \SFRDzZ on the primary BH mass distribution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To isolate the effect of the \SFRDzZ from the effects of different formation channels, we split the data from \cite{vanson+2022} between the stable mass transfer channel \citep[e.g.,][]{van-den-Heuvel+2017,Inayoshi2017,Bavera2021,Marchant2021,GallegosGarcia2021,vanson+2022}, and the `classical' common-envelope channel \citep[or CE channel, e.g.,\  ][]{Belczynski+2007,PostnovYungelson2014,Belczynski+2016Natur,vignaGomez+2018}. 
These channels are distinguished based on whether the binary system has experienced a common envelope phase (CE channel) or only stable mass transfer (stable channel in short from now on).

In Figures \ref{fig: stable mass dists} and \ref{fig: CE mass dists}, we show the resulting primary mass distribution of merging BBHs from the stable channel and CE channel respectively.
The primary (secondary) component refers to the more (less) massive component of merging BBHs. 
Each panel varies one aspect of the \SFRDzZ.  

% The location of features is robust
The first thing we note is that the location of the features in the primary mass distribution are robust against variations in the \SFRDzZ. For the CE channel, the global peak of the mass distribution remains at approximately $\Mbheen\approx16\Msun$ for all variations. 
Similarly, the stable channel displays two peaks that are visible in all variations: a peak at $\Mbheen\approx9\Msun$ and a peak at $\Mbheen\approx22\Msun$. 
Two more peaks are visible in the stable channel at the high mass end for almost all \SFRDzZ (at $\Mbheen\approx35\Msun$ and $\Mbheen\approx45\Msun$), these peaks only fade for variations where the rate of high mass BHs is generally suppressed (dashed lines in top panel of Fig. \ref{fig: stable mass dists}). 
%
This is consistent with the results in \cite{Broekgaarden+2021b}. Although peaks in the probability distribution of chirp masses as shown in their Fig. 4 can disappear when a the \SFRDzZ prohibits the formation of certain (typically higher) mass BHs, the \textit{location} of features remains the same. 
%
This result is furthermore consistent with recent findings in \cite{chruslinska2022_review}. In their Figure 5, they compare two very different models of \SFRDzZ and find that, although the normalisation between the two BBH merger rates is completely different, the location of the peaks remains the same. 
%
This implies that the \textit{locations} of features in the mass distribution of BBHs are determined by the formation channel and its underlying stellar and binary physics. The location of features could therefore serve as tell tales of the underlying physics. 



% Low masses are less affected
Second, we see that the low mass end of the primary mass distribution is relatively robust against variations in the \SFRDzZ. 
To quantify this, we annotate the ratio between the maximum and minimum rate at three reference masses; \Mbheen = $10, 25$, and $40\Msun$.
At $\Mbheen=10\Msun$, we find that the rate changes by at most a factor of about 3.5 for the stable channel, and at most about a factor of 6.5 for the CE channel. 
On the other hand, the change in rate at $\Mbheen=40\Msun$ can be as high as a factor of about 110 and 60 for the stable and CE channel respectively. 
The low mass end of the mass distribution of merging double compact objects will also provide a particularly powerful cosmological constraint in the era of third generation gravitational wave telescopes \citep{MariaEzquiaga2022}. Our finding that the low mass end is more robust against variations in \SFRDzZ supports this claim. 

% The normalisation at z=0 changes the overal rate / normalisation
Parameter variations that affect shape of \SFRDzZ at low redshift primarily change the normalisation of the mass distribution. This is the case for variations of the width of the cosmic metallicity distribution at $z=0$ ($\omega_0$), the mean metallicity of the cosmic metallicity distribution at $z=0$ ($\mu_0$), and the skewness of the cosmic metallicity distribution ($\alpha$, left columns of Figures \ref{fig: stable mass dists} and \ref{fig: CE mass dists}).
To emphasise this point, we annotate the total BBH merger rate at redshift 0.2, $\mathcal{R}_{0.2}$, in the legends of Figures \ref{fig: stable mass dists} and \ref{fig: CE mass dists} (0.2 if the redshift where the observations are best constrained \citealt{GWTC3_popPaper2021}). 
%
Variations that \textit{increase} the amount of star formation at low metallicity (i.e. for a low mean metallicity $\mu_0=0.007$ and a wide metallicity distribution $\omega_0 = 2.0$ ) increase the predicted BBH merger rate. This is consistent with other work that finds merging BBHs form more efficiently at low metallicities \citep[e.g.][]{BelczynskiVink2010, Stevenson+2017,Mapelli2017,Chruslinska2019_effectCO,Broekgaarden+2021b}.
A more skewed cosmic metallicity distribution pushes the peak of the distribution to higher metallicities and thus forms overall more stars at high metallicity when compared to a symmetric distribution. Hence, the local rate of BBH mergers is lower for the skewed distribution ($\alpha = -6$) with respect to the symmetric variation ($\alpha = 0.0$).
% However, the total rate of BBH mergers is only changed by about a factor of 2. 


% Effect of the star formation 
Changing the overall star-formation history (\SFRDz, bottom right panels of Figures \ref{fig: stable mass dists} and \ref{fig: CE mass dists}) also affects the overall normalisation of the mass distribution, but has a smaller effect than the width and the mean of the cosmic metallicity distribution at $z=0$ ($\omega_0$ and $\mu_0$). This underlines the importance of the amount of low-metallicity star formation \citep[e.g.,][]{chruslinska2022_review}, and is furthermore in line with findings from \cite{Tang+2020}.
As discussed in Section \ref{ss: reasonable var}, we use \cite{Madau+2017} and the solid blue line in Figure \ref{fig: SFR(z)} as an approximate lower and upper bound to the \SFRDz respectively. 
The model from \cite{Madau+2017} is very similar to our Fiducial model (Figure \ref{fig: SFR(z)}), and the differences between the resulting mass distributions are correspondingly small. Our approximation of the upper limit to the allowed \SFRDz leads to an overall increase of the BBH merger rate by a factor of about 3. 


% The paramters that affect the redshift evolution change the slope of high mass BHs
Parameters that change the evolution of the metallicity distribution \dpdZ with redshift, such as the redshift dependence of the with and mean; $\omega_z$ and $\mu_z$ (top right and centre right panels of Figures \ref{fig: stable mass dists} and \ref{fig: CE mass dists}) primarily affect the high mass end of the stable channel. 
We understand this as an effect of the different delay time distributions for both formation channels. Since both, $\omega_z$ and $\mu_z$ influence the amount of low metallicity stellar mass formed at high redshifts they will mostly affect systems with longer delay times. The stable channel has been shown to produce more high mass BHs with longer delay times when compared to the CE channel \citep{vanson+2022, Briel+2022}. 
Hence we find these variations affect the slope of the high mass end of the BBH mass distribution for the stable channel, while they have a relatively small impact on the CE channel.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion \& Summary \label{sec: summary}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We present a flexible analytic expression for the metallicity-dependent star formation rate, \SFRDzZ (equations \ref{eq: total sfrd}, \ref{eq: z log skew} and \ref{eq: sfr1}). An analytical expression allows for controlled experiments of the effect of \SFRDzZ on dependent values, such as the rate and mass distribution of merging BBHs. The model presented in this work adopts a skewed-lognormal for the distribution of metallicities at every redshift (\dpdZ). 

\paragraph{The model can capture the general behaviour of cosmological simulations, such as TNG100}
Our analytical expression for \SFRDzZ is composed of a cosmic metallicity distribution that is determined by a mean, scale and skewness and their redshift dependence, as well as parameters governing the overall cosmic star formation rate. We fit our analytical expression for \SFRDzZ to the star-forming gas in the TNG100 simulation, and provide the best fit parameters in Table \ref{tab: fit params}. 
% We fit our analytical expression for \SFRDzZ to the star-forming gas in the TNG100 simulation.
We show that our model captures the shape and general behaviour of the cosmological simulations well (Figure \ref{fig: fit SFRD}). 

\paragraph{The model allows for a controlled experiment on the effect of \SFRDzZ on the local distribution of merging BBH}
As an example, we apply our model to calculate the local rate and mass distribution of the more massive components from merging BBHs (\Mbheen) in Figures \ref{fig: stable mass dists} and \ref{fig: CE mass dists}.
We systematically vary all five parameters that shape the cosmic metallicity distribution, and explore two additional variations of the overall star-formation history \SFRDz.
Our main findings are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item The location of features in the distribution of primary BH masses are robust against variations in the \SFRDzZ. The location of features in the mass distribution of BHs could thus be used as tell-tale signatures of their formation channel. 
    
    \item For all variations, the low mass end of the mass distribution is least affected by changes in the \SFRDzZ. This suggest that lower end of the BH mass distribution (component masses of $\leq 15\Msun$) is potentially very powerful for constraining the physics of the formation channels, irrespective of the cosmic star formation rate uncertainties.
    
    \item The metallicity distribution of star formation at low redshift, primarily impacts the normalisation of the BBH merger rate. Changing the overall star-formation history, \SFRDz also affects the rate, but to a lesser degree. This underlines how low-metallicity star formation at low redshifts dominates the overall normalisation of the BBH merger rate. 
    
    \item Parameters that influence the redshift evolution of the mean and the width of the metallicity distribution, affect the slope of the high mass end of the primary BH mass distribution for the stable channel. This reflects the longer delay times of the stable channel with respect to the CE channel. 
    
\end{itemize}

The flexibility of the model presented in this work can capture the large uncertainties that remain in the shape and normalisation of the metallicity dependent cosmic star formation history. 
Our hope is that this expression will provide a useful starting point for making predictions and comparison with observations.
% As such, we anticipate that it will be a helpful tool in other works that present \SFRDzZ dependent rates.

\section{Determining reasonable variations of the \SFRDzZ \label{app: reasonable var}}
To determine reasonable variations of our fiducial model for \SFRDzZ, we compute the fraction of low and high metallicity stellar mass formed for redshifts below $z<0.5$, $z < 3.0$ and $z<10$. We show the results in Figure \ref{fig: low high Z fraction}, which is an adaptation of Fig. 2 in \cite{Pakmor+2022}, which in turn builds on Fig. 9 from \cite{Chruslinska2019_obs}.

Data from observation-based variations are shown with semi-transparent thick crosses,  \citep[][]{Chruslinska2019_obs} and semi-transparent thick plus signs \citep[][]{Chruslinska+2021}, the low- and high-metallicity extremes are indicated with opague symbols.

Black thin crosses display variations of the cosmic metallicity distribution that is part of our fiducial \SFRDzZ. The parameter that is varied with respect to the fiducial and its new value are annotated. This shows that our \SFRDzZ variations span the range of reasonable cosmic metallicity distributions as determined by observation-based and cosmological simulations-based models.
