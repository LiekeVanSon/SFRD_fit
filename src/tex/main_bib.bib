isbn = {978-0-7503-1563-0},
abstract = {Common envelope evolution is the most important phase in the lives of many significant classes of binary stars. During a common envelope phase, the stars temporarily share the same outer layers, with the cores of both stars orbiting inside the same common envelope. This common envelope is sometimes ejected and helps to explain the formation of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, progenitors for type Ia supernovae, and gravitational-wave mergers. Modeling common envelope evolution is a challenging problem, and this important process has typically been described in evolutionary models using very approximate treatments. This book explains the physics of common envelope evolution and relates it to the approximations that are frequently used for modeling the onset, progression, and outcome of common envelope phases.},

  abstract      = {We demonstrate an algorithm for learning a flexible color-magnitude diagram from noisy parallax and photometry measurements using a normalizing flow, a deep neural network capable of learning an arbitrary multi-dimensional probability distribution. We present a catalog of 640M photometric distance posteriors to nearby stars derived from this data-driven model using Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. Dust estimation and dereddening is done iteratively inside the model and without prior distance information, using the Bayestar map. The signal-to-noise (precision) of distance measurements improves on average by more than 48% over the raw Gaia data, and we also demonstrate how the accuracy of distances have improved over other models, especially in the noisy-parallax regime. Applications are discussed, including significantly improved Milky Way disk separation and substructure detection. We conclude with a discussion of future work, which exploits the normalizing flow architecture to allow us to exactly marginalize over missing photometry, enabling the inclusion of many surveys without losing coverage.},

abstract = "A new methodology for density estimation is proposed. The methodology, which builds on the one developed by Tabak and Vanden-Eijnden, normalizes the data points through the composition of simple maps. The parameters of each map are determined through the maximization of a local quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood. Various candidates for the elementary maps of each step are proposed; criteria for choosing one includes robustness, computational simplicity, and good behavior in high-dimensional settings. A good choice is that of localized radial expansions, which depend on a single parameter: all the complexity of arbitrary, possibly convoluted probability densities can be built through the composition of such simple maps.",

	Abstract = {{We present analytic formulae that approximate the evolution of stars for
        a wide range of mass M and metallicity Z. Stellar luminosity,
        radius and core mass are given as a function of age, M and Z,
        for all phases from the zero-age main sequence up to, and
        including, the remnant stages. For the most part we find
        continuous formulae accurate to within 5 per cent of detailed
        models. These formulae are useful for purposes such as
        population synthesis that require very rapid but accurate
        evaluation of stellar properties, and in particular for use in
        combination with N-body codes. We describe a mass-loss
        prescription that can be used with these formulae, and
        investigate the resulting stellar remnant distribution.}},

@article{Belczynski+2010a,
	Abstract = {{Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (\~{}300,000 galaxies) indicate that
recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half
of the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar
metallicity) and the other half form with small contribution of elements
heavier than helium (\~{}10\%-30\% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss
from the brightest stars derive significantly higher stellar-origin
black hole (BH) masses (\~{}30-80 M $_{sun}$) than previously
estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to
estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) arising
from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a
low-metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double
compact object binaries with at least one BH. In particular, we find the
GW detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is
decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture
of solar and 10\% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the two
largest instruments to neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) binary
inspirals (VIRGO: \~{}9 Mpc; LIGO: \~{}18) is not high enough to ensure a
first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future
instrument increased the sensitivity to \~{}50-100 Mpc, a detection of GWs
would be expected within the first year of observation. It was
previously thought that NS-NS inspirals were the most likely source for
GW detection. Our results indicate that BH-BH binaries are \~{}25 times
more likely sources than NS-NS systems and that we are on the cusp of GW
detection.

@article{Antonini+2016,
	Abstract = {{Hierarchical triple-star systems are expected to form frequently via
close binary-binary encounters in the dense cores of globular
clusters (GCs). In a sufficiently inclined triple, gravitational
interactions between the inner and outer binary can cause
large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the inner orbit
({\ldquo}Lidov-Kozai (LK) cycles{\rdquo}), which can lead to a
collision and merger of the two inner components. In this paper we use
Monte Carlo models of dense star clusters to identify all triple systems
formed dynamically and we compute their evolution using a highly
accurate three-body integrator which incorporates relativistic and tidal
effects. We find that a large fraction of these triples evolve through a
non-secular dynamical phase which can drive the inner binary to higher
eccentricities than predicted by the standard secular perturbation
theory (even including octupole-order terms). We place constraints on
the importance of LK-induced mergers for producing: (i) gravitational
wave sources detectable by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), for triples with an
inner pair of stellar black holes (BHs); and (ii) blue straggler stars,
for triples with main-sequence-star components. We find a realistic
aLIGO detection rate of BH mergers due to the LK mechanism of {\tilde}1
yr$^{-1}$, with about 20\% of these having a finite
eccentricity when they first chirp into the aLIGO frequency band. While
rare, these events are likely to dominate among eccentric compact object
inspirals that are potentially detectable by aLIGO. For blue stragglers,
we find that the LK mechanism can contribute up to {\tilde}10\% of their
total numbers in GCs.

@article{Song+2015,
	Abstract = {{We investigate the impact of tidal interactions, before any mass
transfer, on various properties of the stellar models. We study the
conditions for obtaining homogeneous evolution triggered by tidal
interactions, and for avoiding any Roche lobe overflow during the
Main-Sequence phase. We consider the case of rotating stars computed
with a strong coupling mediated by an interior magnetic field. In models
without any tidal interaction (single stars and wide binaries),
homogeneous evolution in solid body rotating models is obtained when two
conditions are realized: the initial rotation must be high enough, the
loss of angular momentum by stellar winds should be modest. This last
point favors metal-poor fast rotating stars. In models with tidal
interactions, homogeneous evolution is obtained when rotation imposed by
synchronization is high enough (typically a time-averaged surface
velocities during the Main-Sequence phase above 250 km s\$\^{}$\{$-1$\}$\$),
whatever the mass losses. In close binaries, mixing is stronger at
higher than at lower metallicities. Homogeneous evolution is thus
favored at higher metallicities. Roche lobe overflow avoidance is
favored at lower metallicities due to the fact that stars with less
metals remain more compact. We study also the impact of different
processes for the angular momentum transport on the surface abundances
and velocities in single and close binaries. In models where strong
internal coupling is assumed, strong surface enrichments are always
associated to high surface velocities in binary or single star models.
In contrast, models computed with mild coupling may produce strong
surface enrichments associated to low surface velocities. Close binary
models may be of interest for explaining homogeneous massive stars, fast
rotating Wolf-Rayet stars, and progenitors of long soft gamma ray
bursts, even at high metallicities.

	Abstract = {{We consider the formation of binary black hole (BH) mergers through the
        evolution of field massive triple stars. In this scenario,
        favorable conditions for the inspiral of a BH binary are
        initiated by its gravitational interaction with a distant
        companion, rather than by a common-envelope phase invoked in
        standard binary evolution models. We use a code that follows
        self-consistently the evolution of massive triple stars,
        combining the secular triple dynamics (Lidov-Kozai cycles) with
        stellar evolution. After a BH triple is formed, its dynamical
        evolution is computed using either the orbit-averaged equations
        of motion, or a high-precision direct integrator for triples
        with weaker hierarchies for which the secular perturbation
        theory breaks down. Most BH mergers in our models are produced
        in the latter non-secular dynamical regime. We derive the
        properties of the merging binaries and compute a BH merger rate
        in the range (0.3-1.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, or up to
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}2.5 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ if the BH orbital
        planes have initially random orientation. Finally, we show that
        BH mergers from the triple channel have significantly higher
        eccentricities than those formed through the evolution of
        massive binaries or in dense star clusters. Measured
        eccentricities could therefore be used to uniquely identify
        binary mergers formed through the evolution of triple stars.
        While our results suggest up to {\ensuremath{\approx}}10
        detections per year with Advanced-LIGO, the high eccentricities
        could render the merging binaries harder to detect with planned
        space based interferometers such as LISA.}},

	Abstract = {{Recent advances in gravitational-wave astronomy make the direct
detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two stellar-mass
compact objects a realistic prospect. Evolutionary scenarios towards
mergers of double compact objects generally invoke common-envelope
evolution which is poorly understood, leading to large uncertainties in
merger rates. We explore the alternative scenario of massive overcontact
binary (MOB) evolution, which involves two very massive stars in a very
tight binary which remain fully mixed due to their tidally induced high
spin. We use the public stellar-evolution code MESA to systematically
study this channel by means of detailed simulations. We find that, at
low metallicity, MOBs produce double-black-hole (BH+BH) systems that
will merge within a Hubble time with mass ratios close to one, in two
mass ranges, \~{}25...60msun and $\gt$\~{} 130msun, with pair instability
supernovae (PISNe) being produced in-between. Our models are also able
to reproduce counterparts of various stages in the MOB scenario in the
local Universe, providing direct support for it. We map the initial
parameter space that produces BH+BH mergers, determine the expected
chirp mass distribution, merger times, Kerr parameters and predict event
rates. We typically find that for Z\~{}$\lt$Z\_sun/10, there is one BH+BH
merger for \~{}1000 core-collapse supernovae. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO)
detection rate is more uncertain and depends on the metallicity
evolution. Deriving upper and lower limits from a local and a global
approximation for the metallicity distribution of massive stars, we
estimate aLIGO detection rates (at design limit) of \~{}19-550 yr\^{}(-1) for
BH+BH mergers below the PISN gap and of \~{}2.1-370 yr\^{}(-1) above the PISN
gap. Even with conservative assumptions, we find that aLIGO should soon
detect BH+BH mergers from the MOB scenario and that these could be the
dominant source for aLIGO detections.

	Abstract = {{Abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster stars indicate
pollution with material processed by hydrogen burning. Two main sources
have been suggested: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive
stars rotating near the break-up limit (spin stars). We propose massive
binaries as an alternative source of processed material. We compute the
evolution of a 20 $\{$M$\}$_{{\.o}} star in a close binary
considering the effects of non conservative mass and angular momentum
transfer and of rotation and tidal interaction to demonstrate the
principle. We find that this system sheds about 10 $\{$M$\}$_{{\.o}}
of material, nearly the entire envelope of the primary star. The ejecta
are enriched in He, N, Na, and Al and depleted in C and O, similar to
the abundance patterns observed in gobular cluster stars. However, Mg is
not significantly depleted in the ejecta of this model. In contrast to
the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this material is
typically ejected with low velocity. We expect that it remains inside
the potential well of a globular cluster and becomes available for the
formation or pollution of a second generation of stars. We estimate that
the amount of processed low-velocity material ejected by massive
binaries is greater than the contribution of AGB stars and spin stars
combined, assuming that the majority of massive stars in a
proto-globular cluster interact with a companion and return their
envelope to the interstellar medium. If we take the possible
contribution of intermediate mass stars in binaries into account and
assume that the ejecta are diluted with an equal amount of unprocessed
material, we find that this scenario can potentially provide enough
material to form a second generation of low-mass stars, which is as
numerous as the first generation of low-mass stars, without the need to
make commonly adopted assumptions, such as preferential loss of the
first generation of stars, external pollution of the cluster, or an
anomalous initial mass function.

	Abstract = {{Context: Multi wavelength observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A) have
provided us with strong evidence of circumstellar material surrounding
the progenitor star. It has been suggested that its progenitor was a
massive star with strong mass loss. But, despite the large amount of
observational data from optical, IR, radio, and x-ray observations, the
identity of Cas A progenitor is still elusive.  <BR />Aims: In this
work, we computed stellar and circumstellar numerical models to look for
the progenitor of Cas A. The models are compared with the observational
constraints that come from chemical observed abundances and dynamical
information.  <BR />Methods: We first computed stellar evolution models
to get time-dependent wind parameters and surface abundances using the
code STERN. To explore the range of masses proposed by several previous
works, we chose a set of probable progenitor stars with initial masses
of 23, 28, 29, 30, and 33 M_{{\.o}}, with initial solar
composition (Y=0.28, Z=0.02) and mass loss. The derived mass loss rates
and wind terminal velocities are used as inner boundary conditions in
the explicit, hydrodynamical code ZEUS-3D to simulate the evolution of
the circumstellar medium. We simplified the calculations by using
one-dimensional grids in the main sequence and red super-giant (RSG)
stages, and two-dimensional grids for the post-RSG evolution and
supernova (SN) blast wave.  <BR />Results: Our stellar set gives
distinct SN progenitors: RSG, luminous blue super giants (LBSGs), and
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. We named these type of stars {\ldquo}luminous blue
super giant{\rdquo} (LBSGs) to distinguish them from normal blue super
giants (BSGs) of much lower initial masses. The 23 M_{{\.o}}
star explodes as an RSG in a {$\rho$} {\tilde} r^{-2} dense,
free-streaming wind surrounded by a thin, compressed, RSG shell. The 28
M_{{\.o}} star explodes as an LBSG, and the SN blast wave
interacts with a low density, free streaming wind surrounded by an
unstable and massive {\ldquo}RSG+LBSG{\rdquo} shell. Finally, the 30 and
33 M_{{\.o}} stars explode as WR stars surrounded by fast WR
winds that terminate in a highly fragmented {\ldquo}WR+RSG shell{\rdquo}.
We compared the surface chemical abundances of our stellar models with
the observational abundances in Cas A. The abundance analysis shows that
the progenitor was a star with an initial mass of about 30
M_{{\.o}}, while the hydrodynamical analysis favors progenitors
with initial masses around 23.

	Abstract = {{Context. Tides are known to play an important role in binary evolution,
leading in particular to synchronization of axial and orbital rotations
and to binary mass transfer. <BR /> Aims: We study how tides in a binary
system induce some specific internal shear mixing that can substantially
modify the evolution of close binaries prior to mass transfer. <BR />
Methods: We constructed numerical models accounting for tidal
interactions, meridional circulation, transport of angular momentum,
shears and horizontal turbulence. Furthermore, we considered a variety
of orbital periods and initial rotation velocities. <BR /> Results:
Depending on orbital periods and rotation velocities, tidal effects may
spin down (spin-down case) or spin up (spin-up case) the axial rotation.
In both cases, tides may induce a high internal differential rotation.
The resulting tidally induced shear mixing is so efficient that the
internal distributions of angular velocity and chemical elements are
highly influenced. The evolutionary tracks are modified, and in for spin
down as well as for spin up, large amounts of nitrogen can be
transported to the stellar surfaces before any binary mass transfer.
Meridional circulation, when properly treated as a advection, always
tends to counteract the tidal interaction, tending to spin up the
surface when it is braked down and vice versa. As a consequence, the
times needed for the axial angular velocity to become equal to the
orbital angular velocity may be longer than given by typical
synchronization timescales. Moreover, because of the meridional
circulation some differential rotation remains in tidally locked binary
systems.

disappearance of the failed supernova (SN) candidate identified by
Gerke, Kochanek {\amp} Stanek. This {\tilde}25 M$_{⊙}$ red
supergiant experienced a weak {\tilde}10$^{6}$ L$_{⊙}$
optical outburst in 2009 and is now at least 5 mag fainter than the
progenitor in the optical. The mid-IR flux has slowly decreased to the
lowest levels since the first measurements in 2004. There is faint
(2000-3000 L$_{⊙}$) near-IR emission likely associated with
the source. We find the late-time evolution of the source to be
inconsistent with obscuration from an ejected, dusty shell. Models of
the spectral energy distribution indicate that the remaining bolometric
luminosity is $\gt$6 times fainter than that of the progenitor and is
decreasing as {\tilde}t$^{-4/3}$. We conclude that the transient is
unlikely to be an SN impostor or stellar merger. The event is consistent
with the ejection of the envelope of a red supergiant in a failed SN and
the late-time emission could be powered by fallback accretion on to a
newly formed black hole. Future IR and X-ray observations are needed to
confirm this interpretation of the fate for the star.

	Abstract = {{In interacting binaries, comparison of a donor star's radial response to
mass loss (ML) with the response of its Roche radius determines whether
ML persists and, if so, determines the timescale and stability of the
ensuing evolutionary phase. For giants with deep convective envelopes,
the canonical description holds that once mass transfer begins it
typically proceeds catastrophically on the dynamical timescale, as the
star cannot lose sufficient heat in order to avoid expansion. However,
we demonstrate that the local thermal timescale of the envelope's
superadiabatic outer surface layer remains comparable to that of ML in
most cases of ''dynamical'' ML. We argue therefore that if ML proceeds on
a timescale longer than this, then even a deep convective envelope will
not dramatically expand, as the surface layer will have time to relax
thermally and reconstitute itself. We demonstrate that in general the
polytropic approximation gives much too strict a criterion for stability
and discuss the dependence of the donor's response on its radius in
addition to its core mass. In general, we find that the effective
response of the donor on rapid timescales cannot be determined
accurately without detailed evolutionary calculations.

	Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the direct progenitor stars of some core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) are luminous blue variables (LBVs), perhaps including
some Type II ''superluminous supernovae'' (SLSNe). We examine models in
which massive stars gain mass soon after the end of core hydrogen
burning. These are mainly intended to represent mergers following a
brief contact phase during early Case B mass transfer, but may also
represent stars which gain mass in the Hertzsprung Gap or extremely late
during the main-sequence phase for other reasons. The post-accretion
stars spend their core helium-burning phase as blue supergiants (BSGs),
and many examples are consistent with being LBVs at the time of core
collapse. Other examples are yellow supergiants at explosion. We also
investigate whether such post-accretion stars may explode successfully
after core collapse. The final core properties of post-accretion models
are broadly similar to those of single stars with the same initial mass
as the pre-merger primary star. More surprisingly, when early Case B
accretion does affect the final core properties, the effect appears
likely to favor a successful SN explosion, i.e., to make the core
properties more like those of a lower-mass single star. However, the
detailed structures of these cores sometimes display qualitative
differences to any single-star model we have calculated. The rate of
appropriate binary mergers may match the rate of SNe with immediate LBV
progenitors; for moderately optimistic assumptions we estimate that the
progenitor birthrate is \~{}1\% of the CCSN rate.

efficiency of mass transfer {$\beta$}: the fraction of transferred mass
that is accreted by a secondary star. We attempt to constrain the

detailed binary evolution tracks with primary masses
3.5-35$\{$M$\}$_{{\.o}}, orbital periods 1-5 days at a metallicity Z
= 0.004, assuming both conservative and non-conservative mass transfer.
We perform a systematic comparison, using least-squares fitting, of the
computed models with a sample of 50 double-lined eclipsing binaries in
the Small Magellanic Cloud, for which fundamental stellar parameters
have been determined. About 60\% of the systems are currently undergoing
slow mass transfer.   <BR />Results: In general we find good agreement
between our models and the observed detached systems. However, for many
of the semi-detached systems the observed temperature ratio is more
extreme than our models predict. For the 17 semi-detached systems that
we are able to match, we find a large spread in the best fitting
mass-transfer efficiency; no single value of {$\beta$} can explain all
systems. We find a hint that initially wider systems tend to fit better
to less conservative models. We show the need for more accurate
temperature determinations and we find that determinations of surface
abundances of nitrogen and carbon can potentially constrain the
mass-transfer efficiency further.

@article{Wellstein+2001,
	Abstract = {{We present evolutionary calculations for 74 close binaries systems with
initial primary masses in the range 12...25M_{sun}, and initial
secondary masses between 6 and 24M_{sun}. The initial periods
were chosen such that mass overflow starts during the core hydrogen
burning phase of the primary (Case A), or shortly thereafter (Case B).
We use a newly developed binary code with up-to-date physics input. Of
particular relevance is the use of OPAL opacities, and the
time-dependent treatment of semiconvective and thermohaline mixing. We
assume conservative evolution for contact-free systems, i.e., no mass or
angular momentum loss from those system except due to stellar winds. We
investigate the borderline between contact-free evolution and contact,
as a function of the initial system parameters. The fraction of the
parameter space where binaries may evolve while avoiding contact - which
we found already small for the least massive systems considered -
becomes even smaller for larger initial primary masses. At the upper end
of the considered mass range, no contact-free Case B systems exist.
While for primary masses of 16M_{sun} and higher the Case A
systems dominate the contact-free range, at primary masses of
12M_{sun} contact-free systems are more frequent for Case B. We
identify the drop of the exponent x in the main sequence mass-luminosity
relation of the form L\~{} M^{x} as the main cause for this
behaviour. For systems which evolve into contact, we find that this can
occur for distinctively different reasons. While Case A systems are
prone to contact due to reverse mass transfer during or after the
primary's main sequence phase, all systems obtain contact for initial
mass ratios below \~{} 0.65, with a merger as the likely outcome. We also
investigate the effect of the treatment of convection, and found it
relevant for contact and supernova order in Case A systems, particularly
for the highest considered masses. For Case B systems we find contact
for initial periods above \~{} 10 d. However, in that case (and for not too
large periods) contact occurs only after the mass ratio has been
reversed, due to the increased fraction of the donor's convective
envelope. As most of the mass transfer occurs conservatively before
contact is established, this delayed contact is estimated to yield to
the ejection of only a fraction of the donor star's envelope. Our models
yield the value of beta , i.e., the fraction of the primaries envelope
which is accreted by the secondary. We derive the observable properties
of our systems after the major mass transfer event, where the mass
gainer is a main sequence or supergiant O or early B type star, and the
mass loser is a helium star. We point out that the assumption of
conservative evolution for contact-free systems could be tested by
finding helium star companions to O stars. Those are also predicted by
non-conservative models, but with different periods and mass ratios. We
describe strategies for increasing the probability to find helium star
companions in observational search programs.

	Abstract = {{We present new, NTT long-slit spectroscopy of the B[e] supergiant in the
binary system R4 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The data show extended,
forbidden N and S emissions, which are typical signatures of
circumstellar matter. Their extension along the space axis of the slit
defines an angular size of 8.6'', which translates into a linear size of
2.4 pc. The N emission lines also show the velocity structure of a
bipolar outflow expanding at 100 km s$^{-1}$ on average. This
implies that, for a measured radius of 1.2 pc, the outflow originated
about 1.2x10$^{4}$ yr ago. The line flux ratio [N II]
{$\lambda$}6584/[S II] {$\lambda$}6717 indicates that the nebula is nitrogen
enriched and therefore has been ejected from the central star. This is
the first bipolar, ejection nebula detected around a well-established
B[e] supergiant. The bipolar morphology and the chemical enrichment
shown by the nebula associated with R4 are consistent with the picture
of a binary merger, in which R4 was originally a system composed by a
close pair and a third star (the observed A companion). The close pair
merged into a single star and the merging process produced a
circumstellar nebula that was later shaped by the ensuing B star wind.
Since the bipolar morphology, the kinematics and the enriched chemical
composition make the nebula surrounding R4 very similar to the observed
LBV nebulae, our findings imply that at least a few LBV outbursts and
nebulae might well be the result of the merging process of two massive
stars. Based on observations obtained at the European Southern
Observatory, La Silla.

	Abstract = {{We present a dense grid of evolutionary tracks and isochrones of
rotating massive main-sequence stars. We provide three grids with
different initial compositions tailored to compare with early OB stars
in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds and in the Galaxy. Each grid
covers masses ranging from 5 to 60 M$_{&sun;}$ and initial
rotation rates between 0 and about 600 km s$^{-1}$. To calibrate
our models we used the results of the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive
Stars. We determine the amount of convective overshooting by using the
observed drop in rotation rates for stars with surface gravities log g
{\lt} 3.2 to determine the width of the main sequence. We calibrate the
efficiency of rotationally induced mixing using the nitrogen abundance
determinations for B stars in the Large Magellanic cloud. We describe
and provide evolutionary tracks and the evolution of the central and
surface abundances. In particular, we discuss the occurrence of
quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution, i.e. the severe effects of
efficient mixing of the stellar interior found for the most massive fast
rotators. We provide a detailed set of isochrones for rotating stars.
Rotation as an initial parameter leads to a degeneracy between the age
and the mass of massive main sequence stars if determined from its
observed location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We show that the
consideration of surface abundances can resolve this degeneracy.

detached, double-lined eclipsing binaries, as compiled by Andersen. We
present a detailed quantitative comparison of these fundamental data

both with and without the effects of enhanced mixing or overshooting
beyond the convective cores. We use the same prescription for
overshooting that Schroder, Pols {\amp} Eggleton found to reproduce the
properties of zeta Aurigae binaries. For about 80 per cent of the 49
binary systems in the sample, both sets of models provide a good fit to
both stars at a single age and metallicity within the observational
uncertainties. We discuss possible causes for the discrepancies in the
other systems. For only one system, AI Hya, do the enhanced-mixing
models provide a significantly better fit to the data. For two others
(WX Cep and TZ For) the fit to the enhanced-mixing models is also
better. None of the other systems can individually distinguish between
the models with and without enhanced mixing. However, the number of
systems in a post-main-sequence phase is in much better agreement with
the enhanced-mixing models. This test provides supportive evidence for
extended mixing in main-sequence stars in the range 2-3Msolar.

intergalactic gas at redshifts z {\lt}\~{} 5 implies that nonlinear
structure had started to form in the universe at earlier times than we
currently probe. In cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies, the first
generation of baryonic objects emerges at redshifts z \~{} 10--50. Here we
examine the observable consequences of the possibility that an early
generation of stars reionized the universe and resulted in the observed
metallicity of the Ly alpha forest. Forthcoming microwave anisotropy
experiments will be sensitive to the damping of anisotropies caused by
scattering off free electrons from the reionization epoch. For a large
range of CDM models with a Scalo stellar mass function, we find that
reionization occurs at a redshift z {\gt}\~{} 10 and damps the amplitude of
anisotropies on angular scales {\lt}\~{}10 deg by a detectable amount,
\~{}10\%--25\%. However, reionization is substantially delayed if the initial
stellar mass function transformed most of the baryons into low-mass
stars. In this case, the mass fraction of pregalactic stars could be
constrained from the statistics of microlensing events in galactic halos
or along lines of sight to quasars. Deep infrared imaging with future
space telescopes (such as the Space Infrared Telescope Facility or the
Next Generation Space Telescope) will be able to detect bright star

	Abstract = {{We combine a large database of population synthesis calculations, models
for the star formation history of the universe, and a simple selection
model for bursts to predict short GRB detection rates, redshift
distributions, and host galaxy distributions. We compare our space of
possible models with observations of short GRBs (rates and redshifts)
and, when assuming short GRBs are produced from NS-NS binaries, the
current estimates for NS-NS merger rates from close binary pulsars in
the Milky Way. Whether short GRBs are assumed to arise from BH-NS or
NS-NS mergers, we conclude that a fraction of models are in agreement
with available short GRB and binary pulsar observations. We do not need
to introduce artificial models with long delay times. Most commonly,
models produce mergers preferentially in spiral galaxies if short GRBs
arise from NS-NS mergers alone. On the other hand, typically BH-NS
mergers can also occur in elliptical galaxies, in agreement with
existing observations. We expect that a higher proportion of short GRBs
should occur at moderate to high redshift (e.g., z{\gt}1) than has
presently been observed, in agreement with recent observations which
suggest a strong selection bias toward successful follow-up of
low-redshift short GRBs. Finally, if we add plausible additional
assumptions about what BH-NS mergers could produce short GRBs based on
the work of Belczynski and coworkers, then we expect only a small
fraction of BH-NS models could be consistent with all current available
data.

        essential for the interpretation of current and forthcoming
        gravitational wave (GW) detections. We investigate the
        statistics of BHBs that form from isolated binaries, by means of
        a new version of the SEVN population-synthesis code. SEVN
        integrates stellar evolution by interpolation over a grid of
        stellar evolution tracks. We upgraded SEVN to include binary
        stellar evolution processes and we used it to evolve a sample of
        1.5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$ binary systems, with metallicity in
        the range [10$^{-4}$; 4 {\texttimes} 10$^{-2}$]. From our
        simulations, we find that the mass distribution of black holes
        (BHs) in double compact-object binaries is remarkably similar to
        the one obtained considering only single stellar evolution. The
        maximum BH mass we obtain is ̃30, 45, and 55 M\_\{☉\} at
        metallicity Z = 2 {\texttimes} 10$^{-2}$, 6 {\texttimes}

        2 {\texttimes} 10$^{-2}$, 6 {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$, and
        10$^{-4}$, respectively. These BHs fall in the mass gap
        predicted from pair-instability supernovae. We also show that
        the most massive BHBs are unlikely to merge within a Hubble
        time. In our simulations, merging BHs like GW151226 and
        GW170608, form at all metallicities, the high-mass systems (like

        whereas GW170729-like systems are hard to form, even at Z =

@article{Sanyal+2015,
	Abstract = {{Context. Massive stars play a vital role in the Universe, however, their
evolution even on the main-sequence is not yet well understood. <BR />
Aims: Because of the steep mass-luminosity relation, massive
main-sequence stars become extremely luminous. This brings their
envelopes very close to the Eddington limit. We analyse stellar
evolutionary models in which the Eddington limit is reached and
exceeded, explore the rich diversity of physical phenomena that take
place in their envelopes, and investigate their observational
consequences. <BR /> Methods: We use published grids of detailed stellar
models, computed with a state-of-the-art, one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code using LMC composition, to investigate the
envelope properties of core hydrogen burning massive stars. <BR />
Results: We find that the Eddington limit is almost never reached at the
stellar surface, even for stars up to 500 M$_{⊙}$. When we
define an appropriate Eddington limit locally in the stellar envelope,
we can show that most stars more massive than \~{}40 M$_{⊙}$
actually exceed this limit, in particular, in the partial ionisation
zones of iron, helium, or hydrogen. While most models adjust their
structure such that the local Eddington limit is exceeded at most by a
few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor of more than
seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has
severe consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope
inflation, convection, density inversions, and, possibly to, pulsations.
We find that all models with luminosities higher than 4 {\times}
10$^{5}$L$_{⊙}$, i.e. stars above \~{}40 M$_{⊙}$
show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We
find that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a
line beyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two,
indicating a possible connection between S Dor variability and
inflation. Furthermore, our coolest models show highly inflated
envelopes with masses of up to several solar masses, and appear to be
candidates for producing major luminous blue variable eruptions. <BR />
Conclusions: Our models show that the Eddington limit is expected to be
reached in all stars above \~{}40 M$_{⊙}$ in the LMC, even in
lower mass stars in the Galaxy, or in close binaries or rapid rotators.
While our results do not support the idea of a direct super-Eddington
wind driven by continuum photons, the consequences of the Eddington
limit in the form of inflation, pulsations and possibly eruptions may
well give rise to a significant enhancement of the time averaged
mass-loss rate.

those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the
majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar
timing methods, 41 per cent using interferometers and the remaining 1
per cent using optical telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured in one
coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse velocities,
respectively) derived from these measurements are somewhat lower than
earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent electron density
model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the normal
and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6)kms$^{-1}$,
respectively. The corresponding mean 2D speeds are 246(22) and
87(13)kms$^{-1}$. PSRs B2011+38 and B2224+64 have the highest
inferred 2D speeds of \~{}1600 km s$^{-1}$. We study the mean speeds
for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with
previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample
of 73 pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3Myr, we find the mean
three-dimensional (3D) pulsar birth velocity to be
400(40)kms$^{-1}$. The distribution of velocities is well
described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1D rms {$\sigma$}= 265 km
s$^{-1}$. There is no evidence for a bimodal velocity
distribution. The proper motions for PSRs B1830-08 and B2334+61 are
consistent with their proposed associations with the supernova remnants
W41 and G114.3+0.3, respectively.

unity. On the other hand, stars in thermal equilibrium with subadiabatic

finite-amplitude instability exists to which radiative stars are

such a star may undergo a delayed transition to dynamical time scale

like fully convective stars, expanding adiabatically as they lose mass.

	Abstract = {{Our understanding of massive star evolution is in flux due to recent
upheavals in our view of mass loss and observations of a high binary
fraction among O-type stars. Mass-loss rates for standard
metallicity-dependent winds of hot stars are lower by a factor of
2-3 compared with rates adopted in modern stellar evolution codes,
due to the influence of clumping on observed diagnostics. Weaker hot
star winds shift the burden of H-envelope removal to the winds,
pulsations, and eruptions of evolved supergiants, as well as binary mass
transfer. Studies of stripped-envelope supernovae, in particular,
require binary mass transfer. Dramatic examples of eruptive mass loss
are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which have massive shells ejected just
a few years earlier. These eruptions are a prelude to core collapse, and
may signify severe instabilities in the latest nuclear burning phases.
We encounter the predicament that the most important modes of mass loss
are also the most uncertain, undermining the predictive power of
single-star evolution models. Moreover, the influence of winds and
rotation has been evaluated by testing single-star models against
observed statistics that, it turns out, are heavily influenced by binary
evolution. Altogether, this may alter our view about the most basic
outcomes of massive-star mass loss{\mdash}are Wolf-Rayet stars and Type
Ibc supernovae the products of winds, or are they mostly the result of
binary evolution and eruptive mass loss? This is not fully settled, but
mounting evidence points toward the latter. This paradigm shift impacts
other areas of astronomy, because it changes predictions for ionizing
radiation and wind feedback from stellar populations, it may alter
conclusions about star-formation rates and initial mass functions, it
affects the origin of compact stellar remnants, and it influences how we
use supernovae as probes of stellar evolution across cosmic time.

findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared

composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency
between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine

	Abstract = {{Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play an important role in astrophysics,
especially in the study of cosmic evolution. Several progenitor models
for SNe Ia have been proposed in the past. In this paper we carry out a
detailed study of the He star donor channel, in which a carbon-oxygen
white dwarf (CO WD) accretes material from a He main-sequence star or a
He subgiant to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass. Employing
Eggleton's stellar evolution code with an optically thick wind
assumption, and adopting the prescription of Kato {\amp} Hachisu for the
mass accumulation efficiency of the He-shell flashes on to the WDs, we
performed binary evolution calculations for about 2600 close WD binary
systems. According to these calculations, we mapped out the initial
parameters for SNe Ia in the orbital period-secondary mass
(logP$^{i}$ - M$^{i}$$_{2}$) plane for various WD
masses from this channel. The study shows that the He star donor channel
is noteworthy for producing SNe Ia (\~{}1.2 {\times}
10$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ in our Galaxy), and that the progenitors
from this channel may appear as supersoft X-ray sources. Importantly,
this channel can explain SNe Ia with short delay times
($\lt$\~{}10$^{8}$yr), which is consistent with the recent
observational implications of young populations of SN Ia progenitors.

	Abstract = {{A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no
convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of
systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be
the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or
Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a
change in the power-law index at only two masses: near
0.5M_{solar} and near 0.08M_{solar}. Using this supposed
universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of
the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson
noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that
this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in
power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit
within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of
evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in
well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter.
Determinations of the power-law indices {$\alpha$} are subject to
systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The
systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star
IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by
{$\Delta$}{$\alpha$}\~{}0.5 between 0.1 and 1M_{solar} than the
Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old
stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average,
systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto {\amp}
Zoccali; Paresce {\amp} De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient
white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of
associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez {\amp} Minniti)
suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star
formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce
relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the
IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.

	Abstract = {{It now seems likely that some percentage of more massive supernova
progenitors do not explode by any of the currently discussed explosion
mechanisms. This has led to speculation concerning the observable
transients that might be produced if such a supernova fails. Even if a
prompt outgoing shock fails to form in a collapsing presupernova star,
one must still consider the hydrodynamic response of the star to the
abrupt loss of mass via neutrinos as the core forms a protoneutron star.
Following a suggestion by Nadezhin, we calculate the hydrodynamical
responses of typical supernova progenitor stars to the rapid loss of
approximately 0.2-0.5 M $_{⊙}$ of gravitational mass from
their centers. In a red supergiant star, a very weak supernova with
total kinetic energy \~{}10$^{47}$ erg results. The binding energy of
a large fraction of the hydrogen envelope before the explosion is of the
same order and, depending upon assumptions regarding the maximum mass of
a neutron star, most of it is ejected. Ejection speeds are \~{}100 km
s$^{-1}$ and luminosities \~{}10$^{39}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ are maintained for about a year. A significant part
of the energy comes from the recombination of hydrogen. The color of the
explosion is extremely red and the events bear some similarity to
''luminous red novae,'' but have much lower speeds.

	Abstract = {{This work aims to present our current best physical understanding of
common-envelope evolution (CEE). We highlight areas of consensus and
disagreement, and stress ideas which should point the way forward for
progress in this important but long-standing and largely unconquered
problem. Unusually for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying
on results from population synthesis or observations, in order to avoid
potentially being misled by previous misunderstandings. As far as
possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone,
all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before
CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of
the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the
energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the
foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also
given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from
different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial
conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current
numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more
appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new
formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D
processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with
observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent
outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope
binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary
eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.

	Abstract = {{During the evolution of a close binary system, there is a phase with
rapid mass exchange between its component stars. Effects of rapid mass
inflow on the internal structure of the main-sequence stars are studied
in this paper. The mass-receiving star becomes overluminous and its
radius becomes larger. The latter result implies that only a part of the
transferred matter is absorbed into the interior of the mass-receiving
star and that the rest is accumulated just above the original surface of
the star. When the rate of inflow is large, the radius becomes even
comparable with that of a red giant star. When the inflow rate exceeds
60 percent of the critical accretion rate for the 20M star, its radius
diverges. For a smaller-mass star (e.g., 0.75M ), the increase in the
radius is much more appreciable and it reaches as much as 10 times the
initial radius, even when the inflow rate exceeds about 0.1 percent of
the critical value. Such rates of mass exchange have been frequently
encountered by many authors. In such cases, the radius of the
mass-receiving star will exceed its Roche limit, and mass and angular
momentum will be lost from the binary system. Key words: Close binary;
Eddington limit; Internal structure; Mass accretion.

of mass transfer is discussed, with particular attention payed to the
stability of these processes against runaway on the thermal and

giant - neutron star binary systems is used as a specific example of
such mass transfer, and is investigated. Hjellming {\amp} Webbink's
(1987) results on the dynamic timescale response of a convective star

mass transfer is usually stable, as long as the wind's specific angular
momentum does not exceed the angular momentum per reduced mass of the
system. This holds for both dynamical and thermal timescales. Those
systems which are not stable will usually transfer mass on the thermal

	Abstract = {{An empirical comparison of the observed H-R diagrams for the supergiants
in our region of the Oalaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud reveals
comparable distributions of spectral types and luminosities in the two
galaxies. Supergiants of similar spectral types have the same
luminosities, except for the A-type stars, where selection effects may
be important. These results suggest that the same basic physical
processes govern the evolution of the most massive stars in the two
galaxies. Variations in the blue-to-red supergiant ratio with
galactocentric distance and with luminosity involve chemical composition
gradients and varying rates of mass loss. Since the relative numbers of
the most luminous stars are more sensitive to mass loss, the B/R ratio
from the less luminous supergiants may be a better indicator of galactic
abundance gradients. The upper luminosity boundary for both the galactic
and the LMC supergiants is characterized by (1) decreasing luminosity
with decreasing temperature for the hottest stars and (2) an upper limit
to the luminosities near Mbol - 9.5 to - 10 mag for stars cooler than
15,000 K. We suggest that the observed luminosity limits are due
primarily to the effects of large mass loss on the evolution of the most
massive stars. The examples of Car and P Cyg suggest that mass-loss
rates can be very rapid and unsteady-higher on the average than
presently observed for most of the hot supergiants. The evolution of
stars greater than 60 to cooler temperatures is consequently limited by
instabilities and the accompanying high mass loss. An initial mass near
may be an empirical upper limit to the mass at which a star can evolve
to the region of the M supergiants and probably accounts for the
observed upper bound to the luminosities of the cooler supergiants.

Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars as a function of metal abundance, over a range
between 10^{-5} {\le} (Z/Z_{{\.o}}) {\le} 10. We find
that the winds of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars are dominated by iron
lines, with a dependence of mass loss on Z similar to that of massive OB
stars. For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind strength is also
found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend on the
chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss
metallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding
that WR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important
consequences for black hole formation and X-ray population studies in
external galaxies. A further finding of our study is that the Z
dependence of C-rich WR stars becomes weaker at metallicities below
Z/Z_{{\.o}} {\lap} 1/10, and mass loss no longer declines once
the metal abundance drops below (Z/Z_{{\.o}}) {\sime}
10^{-3}. This is the result of an increased importance of
radiative driving by intermediate mass elements, such as carbon. In
combination with rapid rotation and/or proximity to the Eddington limit
- likely to be relevant for massive Population iii stars - this effect
may indicate a role for mass loss in the appearance and evolution of
these objects, as well as a potential role for stellar winds in
enriching the intergalactic medium of the early Universe.

	Abstract = {{Inhomogeneous Wolf-Rayet type stellar winds are modeled in a first-order
approximation, assuming that small-scale clumps are distributed with a
constant volume filling factor within an interclump space which is void.
Model calculations as well as analytical considerations show that the
main spectral features, i.e. the strength of the emission lines, are
approximately invariant if the enhanced density in the clump medium is
compensated by a suitable scaling of the mass-loss rate. Hence, to the
first order the mass-loss rate is the only empirical parameter which is
affected by the application of clumped models for spectral analyses. In
clumpy atmospheres the electron-scattering line wings become weaker than
in homogeneous models. This effect can be used to determine the degree
of clumping empirically. We select Wolf-Rayet stars of different
spectral subclasses and compare their spectra with adequate models,
varying the clumpiness. In all cases, the homogeneous model can be
definitely ruled out because it predicts electron scattering wings that
are significantly stronger than observed. If the clumps fill 1/4 of the
volume, the line wings are in reasonable agreement, while for a filling
factor of 1/16 the wings are possibly too shallow, but still compatible
with the observation within the error margin. Adopting a filling factor
of 1/4 (i.e. the density in the clumps is enhanced by a factor of four,
compared to a smooth model with same mass-loss rate) as a typical value,
the empirical mass-loss rates become smaller by a factor of two than
obtained with homogeneous models.

	Abstract = {{We present the spectrum of compact object masses: neutron stars and
black holes (BHs) that originate from single stars in different
environments. In particular, we calculate the dependence of maximum BH
mass on metallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates (e.g.,
Hurley et al. and Vink et al.). Our calculations show that the highest
mass BHs observed in the Galaxy M _{bh} \~{} 15 M _{sun} in
the high metallicity environment (Z = Z _{sun} = 0.02) can be
explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.
To reach this result we had to set luminous blue variable mass loss
rates at the level of \~{}10^{-4} M _{sun} yr^{-1}
and to employ metallicity-dependent Wolf-Rayet winds. With such winds,
calibrated on Galactic BH mass measurements, the maximum BH mass
obtained for moderate metallicity (Z = 0.3 Z _{sun} = 0.006) is
M _{bh,max} = 30 M _{sun}. This is a rather striking
finding as the mass of the most massive known stellar BH is M
_{bh} = 23-34 M _{sun} and, in fact, it is located in a
small star-forming galaxy with moderate metallicity. We find that in the
very low (globular cluster-like) metallicity environment the maximum BH
mass can be as high as M _{bh,max} = 80 M _{sun} (Z =
0.01 Z _{sun} = 0.0002). It is interesting to note that X-ray
luminosity from Eddington-limited accretion onto an 80 M _{sun}
BH is of the order of \~{}10^{40} erg s^{-1} and is
comparable to luminosities of some known ultra-luminous X-ray sources.
We emphasize that our results were obtained for single stars only and
that binary interactions may alter these maximum BH masses (e.g.,
accretion from a close companion). This is strictly a proof-of-principle
study which demonstrates that stellar models can naturally explain even
the most massive known stellar BHs.

quiescent phases of helium shell flash cycles. The mass loss rates
produced by the superwinds are similar to those required for PN

for the existence of AGB stars with hollow shells and multiple shell

rates for a wide range of metal abundances between 1/100 {\lt}=
Z/Z_{sun} {\lt}= 10. The calculation of this grid completes the
Vink et al. (2000) mass-loss recipe with an additional parameter Z. We
have found that the exponent of the power law dependence of mass loss
vs. metallicity is constant in the range between 1/30 {\lt}=
Z/Z_{sun} {\lt}= 3. The mass-loss rate scales as dot M \~{}
Z^{0.85} v_{infty }^{p} with p = -1.23 for stars
with T\_eff {\gt}\~{} 25 000 K, and p = -1.60 for the B supergiants with
T\_eff {\lt}\~{} 25 000 K. Taking also into account the metallicity
dependence of v_{infty }, using the power law dependence
v_{infty } \~{} Z^{0.13} from Leitherer et al. (1992), the
overall result of mass loss as a function of metallicity can be
represented by dot M \~{} Z^{0.69} for stars with T\_eff {\gt}\~{} 25
000 K, and dot M \~{} Z^{0.64} for B supergiants with T\_eff {\lt}\~{}
25 000 K. Although it is derived that the exponent of the mass loss vs.
metallicity dependence is constant over a large range in Z, one should
be aware of the presence of bi-stability jumps at specific temperatures.
Here the character of the line driving changes drastically due to
recombinations of dominant metal species resulting in jumps in the mass
loss. We have investigated the physical origins of these jumps and have
derived formulae that combine mass loss recipes for both sides of such
jumps. As observations of different galaxies show that the ratio Fe/O
varies with metallicity, we make a distinction between the metal
abundance Z derived on the basis of iron or oxygen lines. Our mass-loss
predictions are successful in explaining the observed mass-loss rates
for Galactic and Small Magellanic Cloud O-type stars, as well as in
predicting the observed Galactic bi-stability jump. Hence, we believe
that our predictions are reliable and suggest that our mass-loss recipe
be used in future evolutionary calculations of massive stars at
different metal abundance. A computer routine to calculate mass loss is
publicly available.

Agreement between the observed and new theoretical wind momenta
increases confidence in the possibility to derive distances to luminous

of B stars does follow the new theoretical relation, while another group

	Abstract = {{We present a rapid binary-evolution algorithm that enables modelling of
even the most complex binary systems. In addition to all aspects of
single-star evolution, features such as mass transfer, mass accretion,
common-envelope evolution, collisions, supernova kicks and angular
momentum loss mechanisms are included. In particular, circularization
and synchronization of the orbit by tidal interactions are calculated
for convective, radiative and degenerate damping mechanisms. We use this
algorithm to study the formation and evolution of various binary
systems. We also investigate the effect that tidal friction has on the
outcome of binary evolution. Using the rapid binary code, we generate a
series of large binary populations and evaluate the formation rate of
interesting individual species and events. By comparing the results for
populations with and without tidal friction, we quantify the hitherto
ignored systematic effect of tides and show that modelling of tidal
evolution in binary systems is necessary in order to draw accurate
conclusions from population synthesis work. Tidal synchronism is
important but, because orbits generally circularize before Roche lobe
overflow, the outcome of the interactions of systems with the same
semilatus rectum is almost independent of eccentricity. It is not
necessary to include a distribution of eccentricities in population
synthesis of interacting binaries; however, the initial separations
should be distributed according to the observed distribution of
semilatera recta rather than periods or semimajor axes.

abundances are chosen as functions of the metallicity:
X=0.76-3.0ZY=0.24+2.0Z. Two sets of models were computed, one without
and one with a certain amount of enhanced mixing or `overshooting'. This
amount has been empirically chosen by means of various sensitive tests
for overshooting: (1) the luminosity of core helium burning (blue loop)
giants of well-known mass, (2) the width of the main sequence as defined
by double-lined eclipsing binaries with well-measured masses and radii,
and (3) the shape and implied stellar distribution of isochrones of
various open clusters. The first two tests have been the subject of
previous papers, the third test is discussed in this paper. On the basis
of these tests, we recommend the use of the overshooting models for
masses above about 1.5Msolar. We describe here the characteristics of
the models, the procedure for constructing isochrones for arbitrary age
and metallicity from the models, and the performance of these isochrones
for several intermediate-age and old open clusters. All original models
are available in electronic form and we describe the means by which they

	Abstract = {{Double black hole binaries are among the most important sources of
gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as LIGO or
VIRGO. Even if formed with lower efficiency than double neutron star
binaries, they could dominate the predicted detection rates, since black
holes are more massive than neutron stars and therefore could be
detected at greater distances. Here we discuss an evolutionary process
that could very significantly limit the formation of close double black
hole binaries: the vast majority of their potential progenitors undergo
a common-envelope (CE) phase while the donor, one of the massive binary
components, is evolving through the Hertzsprung gap. Our latest
theoretical understanding of the CE process suggests that this will
probably lead to a merger, inhibiting double black hole formation.
Barring uncertainties in the physics of CE evolution, we use population
synthesis calculations and find that the corresponding reduction in the
merger rate of double black holes formed in galactic fields is so great
(by \~{}500) that their contribution to inspiral detection rates for
ground-based detectors could become relatively small (\~{}1 in 10) compared
to double neutron star binaries. A similar process also reduces the
merger rates for double neutron stars, by a factor of \~{}5, eliminating
most of the previously predicted ultracompact NS-NS systems. Our
predicted detection rates for Advanced LIGO are now much lower for
double black holes (\~{}2 yr$^{-1}$), but are still quite high for
double neutron stars (\~{}20 yr$^{-1}$). If double black holes were
found to be dominant in the detected inspiral signals, this could
indicate that they mainly originate from dense star clusters (not
included here) or that our theoretical understanding of the CE phase
requires significant revision.

	Abstract = {{Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (\~{}300,000 galaxies) indicate that
recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half
of the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar
metallicity) and the other half form with small contribution of elements
heavier than helium (\~{}10\%-30\% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss
from the brightest stars derive significantly higher stellar-origin
black hole (BH) masses (\~{}30-80 M $_{sun}$) than previously
estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to
estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) arising
from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a
low-metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double
compact object binaries with at least one BH. In particular, we find the
GW detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is
decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture
of solar and 10\% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the two
largest instruments to neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) binary
inspirals (VIRGO: \~{}9 Mpc; LIGO: \~{}18) is not high enough to ensure a
first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future
instrument increased the sensitivity to \~{}50-100 Mpc, a detection of GWs
would be expected within the first year of observation. It was
previously thought that NS-NS inspirals were the most likely source for
GW detection. Our results indicate that BH-BH binaries are \~{}25 times
more likely sources than NS-NS systems and that we are on the cusp of GW
detection.

predictions that massive binary black holes would constitute the first
detection. Previous calculations, however, have not sampled the relevant
binary-black-hole progenitors{\mdash}massive, low-metallicity binary
stars{\mdash}with sufficient accuracy nor included sufficiently realistic
physics to enable robust predictions to better than several orders of
magnitude. Here we report high-precision numerical simulations of the
formation of binary black holes via the evolution of isolated binary
stars, providing a framework within which to interpret the first
gravitational-wave source, GW150914, and to predict the properties of
subsequent binary-black-hole gravitational-wave events. Our models imply
that these events form in an environment in which the metallicity is
less than ten per cent of solar metallicity, and involve stars with
initial masses of 40-100 solar masses that interact through mass
transfer and a common-envelope phase. These progenitor stars probably
formed either about 2 billion years or, with a smaller probability, 11
billion years after the Big Bang. Most binary black holes form without
supernova explosions, and their spins are nearly unchanged since birth,
but do not have to be parallel. The classical field formation of binary
black holes we propose, with low natal kicks (the velocity of the black
hole at birth) and restricted common-envelope evolution, produces
approximately 40 times more binary-black-holes mergers than do dynamical
formation channels involving globular clusters; our predicted detection
rate of these mergers is comparable to that from homogeneous evolution
channels. Our calculations predict detections of about 1,000 black-hole
mergers per year with total masses of 20-80 solar masses once
second-generation ground-based gravitational-wave observatories reach
full sensitivity.

	Abstract = {{Context. Mergers of two stellar-origin black holes are a prime source of
        gravitational waves and are under intensive investigation. One
        crucial ingredient in their modeling has been neglected: pair-
        instability pulsation supernovae with associated severe mass
        loss may suppress the formation of massive black holes,
        decreasing black-hole-merger rates for the highest black-hole
        masses. <BR /> Aims: We demonstrate the effects of pair-
        instability pulsation supernovae on merger rate and mass using
        populations of double black-hole binaries formed through the
        isolated binary classical evolution channel. <BR /> Methods: The
        mass loss from pair-instability pulsation supernova is estimated
        based on existing hydrodynamical calculations. This mass loss is
        incorporated into the StarTrack population synthesis code.
        StarTrack is used to generate double black-hole populations with
        and without pair-instability pulsation supernova mass loss. <BR
        /> Results: The mass loss associated with pair-instability
        pulsation supernovae limits the Population I/II stellar-origin
        black-hole mass to 50 M$_{☉}$, in tension with earlier
        predictions that the maximum black-hole mass could be as high as
        100 M$_{☉}$. In our model, neutron stars form with mass 1-2
        M$_{☉}$. We then encounter the first mass gap at 2-5 M$_{☉}$
        with the compact object absence due to rapid supernova
        explosions, followed by the formation of black holes with mass
        5-50 M$_{☉}$, with a second mass gap at 50-135 M$_{☉}$ created
        by pair-instability pulsation supernovae and by pair-instability
        supernovae. Finally, black holes with masses above 135 M$_{☉}$
        may potentially form to arbitrarily high mass limited only by
        the extent of the initial mass function and the strength of
        stellar winds. Suppression of double black-hole-merger rates by
        pair-instability pulsation supernovae is negligible for our
        evolutionary channel. Our standard evolutionary model, with the
        inclusion of pair-instability pulsation supernovae and pair-
        instability supernovae, is fully consistent with the Laser
        Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)
        observations of black-hole mergers: GW150914, GW151226, and
        LVT151012. The LIGO results are inconsistent with high
        ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 400 km s$^{-1}$) black hole (BH) natal
        kicks. We predict the detection of several, and up to as many as
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde60, BH-BH mergers with a total
        mass of 10-150 M$_{☉}$ (most likely range: 20-80 M$_{☉}$) in the
        forthcoming \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde60 effective days of
        the LIGO O2 observations, assuming the detectors reach the
        optimistic target O2 sensitivity.}},

	Abstract = {{We review the formation and evolution of compact binary stars consisting
        of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), and black holes
        (BHs). Mergings of compact-star binaries are expected to be the
        most important sources for forthcoming gravitational-wave (GW)
        astronomy. In the first part of the review, we discuss
        observational manifestations of close binaries with NS and/or BH
        components and their merger rate, crucial points in the
        formation and evolution of compact stars in binary systems,
        including the treatment of the natal kicks, which NSs and BHs
        acquire during the core collapse of massive stars and the common
        envelope phase of binary evolution, which are most relevant to
        the merging rates of NS-NS, NS-BH and BH-BH binaries. The second
        part of the review is devoted mainly to the formation and
        evolution of binary WDs and their observational manifestations,
        including their role as progenitors of cosmologically-important
        thermonuclear SN Ia. We also consider AM CVn-stars, which are
        thought to be the best verification binary GW sources for future
        low-frequency GW space interferometers.}},

Advanced detectors in the near future and third-generation observatories in more than one decade will open the possibility to perform gravitational wave astronomical observations from the Earth. An overview of the possible science reaches and the technological progress needed to realize a third-generation observatory are discussed in this paper.

The Einstein Telescope (ET), a third-generation gravitational wave detector, has been proposed in order to fully open up the emerging field of gravitational wave astronomy. In this paper we describe sensitivity models for ET and investigate potential limits imposed by fundamental noise sources. A special focus is set on evaluating the frequency band below 10 Hz where a complex mixture of seismic, gravity gradient, suspension thermal and radiation pressure noise dominates. We develop the most accurate sensitivity model, referred to as ET-D, for a third-generation detector so far, including the most relevant fundamental noise contributions.}

abstract = {Common envelope evolution is the most important phase in the lives of many significant classes of binary stars. During a common envelope phase, the stars temporarily share the same outer layers, with the cores of both stars orbiting inside the same common envelope. This common envelope is sometimes ejected and helps to explain the formation of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, progenitors for type Ia supernovae, and gravitational-wave mergers. Modeling common envelope evolution is a challenging problem, and this important process has typically been described in evolutionary models using very approximate treatments. This book explains the physics of common envelope evolution and relates it to the approximations that are frequently used for modeling the onset, progression, and outcome of common envelope phases.},

abstract = {Common envelope evolution is the most important phase in the lives of many significant classes of binary stars. During a common envelope phase, the stars temporarily share the same outer layers, with the cores of both stars orbiting inside the same common envelope. This common envelope is sometimes ejected and helps to explain the formation of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, including cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, progenitors for type Ia supernovae, and gravitational-wave mergers. Modeling common envelope evolution is a challenging problem, and this important process has typically been described in evolutionary models using very approximate treatments. This book explains the physics of common envelope evolution and relates it to the approximations that are frequently used for modeling the onset, progression, and outcome of common envelope phases.},

  abstract      = {We demonstrate an algorithm for learning a flexible color-magnitude diagram from noisy parallax and photometry measurements using a normalizing flow, a deep neural network capable of learning an arbitrary multi-dimensional probability distribution. We present a catalog of 640M photometric distance posteriors to nearby stars derived from this data-driven model using Gaia DR2 photometry and parallaxes. Dust estimation and dereddening is done iteratively inside the model and without prior distance information, using the Bayestar map. The signal-to-noise (precision) of distance measurements improves on average by more than 48% over the raw Gaia data, and we also demonstrate how the accuracy of distances have improved over other models, especially in the noisy-parallax regime. Applications are discussed, including significantly improved Milky Way disk separation and substructure detection. We conclude with a discussion of future work, which exploits the normalizing flow architecture to allow us to exactly marginalize over missing photometry, enabling the inclusion of many surveys without losing coverage.},

The parameters of each map are determined through the maximization of a local quadratic approximation to the log-likelihood. Various candidates for the elementary maps of each step are proposed; criteria for choosing one includes robustness, computational simplicity, and good behavior in high-dimensional settings. A good choice is that of localized radial expansions, which depend on a single parameter: all the complexity of arbitrary, possibly convoluted probability densities can be built through the composition of such simple maps.",

        a wide range of mass M and metallicity Z. Stellar luminosity,
        radius and core mass are given as a function of age, M and Z,
        for all phases from the zero-age main sequence up to, and
        including, the remnant stages. For the most part we find
        continuous formulae accurate to within 5 per cent of detailed
        models. These formulae are useful for purposes such as
        population synthesis that require very rapid but accurate
        evaluation of stellar properties, and in particular for use in
        combination with N-body codes. We describe a mass-loss
        prescription that can be used with these formulae, and
        investigate the resulting stellar remnant distribution.}},

@article{Belczynski+2010a,
	Abstract = {{Data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (\~{}300,000 galaxies) indicate that
recent star formation (within the last 1 billion years) is bimodal: half
of the stars form from gas with high amounts of metals (solar
metallicity) and the other half form with small contribution of elements
heavier than helium (\~{}10\%-30\% solar). Theoretical studies of mass loss
from the brightest stars derive significantly higher stellar-origin
black hole (BH) masses (\~{}30-80 M $_{sun}$) than previously
estimated for sub-solar compositions. We combine these findings to
estimate the probability of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) arising
from the inspiral of double compact objects. Our results show that a
low-metallicity environment significantly boosts the formation of double
compact object binaries with at least one BH. In particular, we find the
GW detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the metallicity is
decreased from solar (as in all previous estimates) to a 50-50 mixture
of solar and 10\% solar metallicity. The current sensitivity of the two
largest instruments to neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) binary
inspirals (VIRGO: \~{}9 Mpc; LIGO: \~{}18) is not high enough to ensure a
first detection. However, our results indicate that if a future
instrument increased the sensitivity to \~{}50-100 Mpc, a detection of GWs
would be expected within the first year of observation. It was
previously thought that NS-NS inspirals were the most likely source for
GW detection. Our results indicate that BH-BH binaries are \~{}25 times
more likely sources than NS-NS systems and that we are on the cusp of GW
detection.
